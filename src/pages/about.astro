    <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold dark:text-neutral-200">Who I Am?</h2>
    <p class="text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400 sm:leading-7 lg:leading-8 sm:text-base lg:text-lg">

      I am <strong>Rishwanth Perumandla</strong>, a Software Engineer with more than four years of experience working across cloud infrastructure, backend systems, data platforms, and applied machine learning. I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from <strong>Purdue University</strong>, where I focused on cloud architecture, data systems, and building ML driven applications that work reliably in the real world.<br /><br />

      My professional journey began at <strong><a href="https://www.rivach.com" class="underline hover:text-black dark:hover:text-white" target="_blank">Rivach LLP</a></strong>, where I learned how to build entire products from the ground up. I worked on everything from frontend development to backend architecture, while also managing deployments, database design, and cloud infrastructure. I enjoyed moving between design discussions, engineering problems, and product decisions, which helped me understand how technology becomes meaningful for real users.<br /><br />

      Later, at <strong><a href="https://www.centella.ai" class="underline hover:text-black dark:hover:text-white" target="_blank">Centella Scientific</a></strong>, I worked on CASCADE, an AI powered drug discovery platform for oncology research. This role brought me closer to the intersection of engineering and scientific research. I built backend systems for molecular design using REINVENT, supported large scale virtual screening workloads, and deployed ML pipelines across Azure and Google Cloud. I also worked on ADMET prediction systems, improved inference performance for GNN models, and helped create an infrastructure that scientists could rely on for fast and repeatable experimentation.<br /><br />

      During my time at Purdue, I worked on projects that strengthened my understanding of data engineering, applied ML, and backend development. One of my favorite projects was a hybrid recommendation system that combined text embeddings, computer vision models, and collaborative filtering. I also built LandManager, a multi role SaaS platform that included analytics dashboards, secure APIs, and optimized Postgres pipelines.<br /><br />

      Across everything I do, what matters most to me is clarity, structure, and impact. I enjoy designing systems that feel reliable and predictable, and I value writing code that is clean, thoughtful, and built to evolve.<br /><br />

      Outside engineering, I explore storytelling and filmmaking through my creative identity, <a class="ripe text-3xl" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ripe6096" target="_blank">RIPE</a>. I love writing stories, experimenting with CGI in Unreal Engine, and building small fictional worlds. These creative interests give me a different way to think about technology. Storytelling teaches rhythm and emotion. Engineering teaches structure and precision. I try to bring both into everything I create.<br /><br />

      I believe that good technology should feel simple, honest, and human. And that is what I enjoy building the most.
