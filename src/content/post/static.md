> "Anyone can build a website. But designing one that scales, remains cost-efficient, and supports evolving business needs ‚Äî that‚Äôs real architecture."

This is a professional case study on how I ‚Äî as a Solutions Architect ‚Äî approach building a modern website from scratch for a small-to-mid scale business.

---

## Introduction

A business approaches with a requirement to build a professional website. As a Solutions Architect, my role is not just to develop it, but to understand the problem from a business and technical perspective. The goal is to design a cost-efficient, scalable, and maintainable solution aligned with user expectations and operational constraints. This document represents my approach in handling such a requirement ‚Äî from discovery to architecture decisions and cost estimation.

---

## Discovery Phase

### What we need to know

1. **What is the website for?**

   * Brand visibility?
   * Showcase of services?
   * Generating leads or inquiries?
   * Content publishing?

2. **Who is the target audience and expected traffic?**

   * What is the projected average daily traffic?
   * Are there seasonal spikes or marketing campaigns expected?

3. **What is the client's budget?**

   * Initial budget for design and development?
   * Ongoing yearly maintenance and hosting?

4. **What content will be available?**

   * Will the client provide structured web copy?
   * Do they expect help with content strategy?

5. **Design expectations?**

   * Do they want to use a pre-built template?
   * Are custom design elements or animations required?

## Use Case: Static Business Website

Let‚Äôs assume the following requirement:

* Multi-page website (Home, About, Services, Contact)
* Basic contact form
* < 100 users/day
* Limited budget

This type of project seems simple ‚Äî but my job is to ensure it‚Äôs resilient, fast, and future-ready.

## Evaluating Shared Hosting

The most common go-to for small business websites is shared hosting through providers like Hostinger, GoDaddy, or Bluehost.

These platforms offer plans starting as low as \$2‚Äì10/month and come with bundled features like:

* Domain + SSL
* One-click WordPress installation
* cPanel-based deployment

While this might seem ideal, these plans have a major limitation: **bandwidth**.

> Example: A basic shared plan might allow 10GB/month.
> If the homepage is 1MB and 1,000 people visit in one day, that's 1GB already used.

Additionally:

* You‚Äôre co-hosted with hundreds of other websites (performance varies)
* Server scaling is not possible
* DDoS protection and auto-healing are limited

As a Solutions Architect, my responsibility is to look beyond cost and consider future traffic surges, SEO performance, and uptime.

This is where we consider AWS.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Re-Architecting the Website with AWS

Instead of just ‚Äúhosting‚Äù the site, the aim is to design for scalability, availability, and cost-efficiency ‚Äî backed by AWS cloud services. The choice of services depends on technical complexity, required uptime, expected traffic, and budget.

---

### Option 1: **S3 + CloudFront** ‚Äî Scalable Static Hosting

**Architecture**:

* HTML, CSS, JS, and assets are hosted on an S3 bucket.
* CloudFront is configured as the CDN with edge locations globally.
* Route 53 manages the DNS with low-latency routing.
* SSL is handled by ACM with TLS 1.2 enforcement.

**Why this setup?**

* Designed for durability (S3: 99.999999999%)
* Low-latency delivery globally using edge caching
* Pay-as-you-go ‚Äî ideal for unpredictable traffic
* Serverless; no need for patching or scaling

**Security Controls**:

* S3 public access is blocked
* OAI (Origin Access Identity) used for secure CloudFront access
* All endpoints HTTPS-only

**Cost Example**:

* 3GB egress via CloudFront: \~\$0.25
* 2GB S3 storage: \~\$0.05
* Route 53 hosted zone: \$0.50
* ACM: Free

**Estimated Total**: **<\$1/month**

### Option 2: **Lightsail + WordPress** ‚Äî Simplified CMS Hosting

**Architecture**:

* Lightsail instance pre-configured with WordPress
* Static IP with TLS enabled
* Optional S3 media storage with WP-S3 plugin

**Why Lightsail?**

* Predictable pricing and UI simplicity
* Supports small teams and content editors
* Built-in monitoring and snapshots

**Security**:

* Regular patching required via SSH
* Enable UFW, fail2ban, and only expose HTTPS and SSH

**Cost**:

* \$5/month instance + \$1 static IP (if not attached)
* Optional: CloudFront for faster asset delivery

### Option 3: **Elastic Beanstalk (EC2 + RDS)** ‚Äî Managed WordPress Stack

**Architecture**:

* EC2-based WordPress with auto-scaling
* RDS MySQL backend
* Load Balancer for HA
* Deployed via Beanstalk environment with health checks

**Why Beanstalk?**

* Infra managed behind the scenes
* Health dashboards and deployment rollbacks
* Horizontal scaling and blue-green deployments possible

**Cost**:

* EC2 t3.micro: \~\$9
* RDS t3.micro: \~\$15
* Load Balancer: \~\$18

**Total**: \~\$42/month

### Option 4: **Custom EC2 + RDS** ‚Äî Fully Manual Infra

**Architecture**:

* Nginx + PHP-FPM setup on EC2
* MySQL database via RDS
* S3 for media + CloudFront as CDN
* Managed via SSH + SystemD + Cron

**Why this?**

* Complete flexibility and optimization
* Ideal for infrastructure-heavy teams

**Challenges**:

* Requires patching, scaling, and recovery scripts
* Higher learning curve and risks

**Estimated Cost**:

* \~\$60/month fully loaded

---

## Image & Asset Strategy

* Store all static media in S3 with lifecycle rules
* CDN delivered via CloudFront with caching headers
* Signed URLs and versioning for access control

**Advantages**:

* Reduced TTFB and origin server load
* Parallel domain strategy for high LCP pages
* Easy purging and asset invalidation via CLI/CDN APIs

## Final Thoughts

This wasn‚Äôt just about publishing a few static pages. This was a rigorous evaluation and execution exercise ‚Äî where I combined cost analysis, scalability planning, and system resilience principles to propose a future-proof solution. Each decision here reflects tradeoff reasoning, not just technology selection.
